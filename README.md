A loop library for PHP.

# Installation

Run the following command inside of your project directory.

```bash
composer require enzyme/loopy
```

# Usage

#### Simple

A simple loop over an array.

```php
use Enzyme\Loopy\Each;

$array = [1, 2, 3];

Each::shallow()->begin($array, function($bag) {
    echo $bag->value() . ', ';
});
```

The above will output `1, 2, 3, `

#### Deep

A deep loop over a multidimensional array.

```php
use Enzyme\Loopy\Each;

$array = [1, 2, 3, 4 => [4, 5, 6]];

Each::deep()->begin($array, function($bag) {
    echo $bag->value() . ', ';
});
```

The above will output `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, `

#### Filtered

A loop over a filtered array.

```php
use Enzyme\Loopy\Each;
use Enzyme\Loopy\Filters\SkipNulls;

$array = [1, 2, null, 4, 5];

Each::deep(new SkipNulls)->begin($array, function($bag) {
    echo $bag->value() . ', ';
});
```

The above will output `1, 2, 4, 5, `

# Bags

The `$bag` object passed to the callback function generally contains the follow information.

Key | Value | Description
----|-------|------------
key() | Key | The enumerable objects key for the given pass.
value() | Value | The enumerable objects value for the given pass.
cycle() | Current cycle (0 based) | How many times around the entire object the looper has gone.
depth() | Current depth (0 based) | The current depth of the pass, for multidimensional arrays.
index() | Current index (0 based) | The current index, in this case index is really a count of the number of items encountered so far.

# Filters

Filter | Description
-------|------------
SkipNulls | Will skip over any values which are null.
Regex | Will test value against the supplied regular expression.
Equal | Will test value for equality against the given rule. (===)
Less | Will test that value is less than the give rule, or less than or equal if parameter 2 in the constructor is set to true.
Greater | Will test that value is greater than the give rule, or greater than or equal if parameter 2 in the constructor is set to true.
